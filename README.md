# BSComSciCapstone

This is a repository for my capstone project for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science degree.
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning model off of some form of data that is collected.
The data chosesn for this project was a "Online Video Characteristics and Transcoding Time Dataset Data Set" from
the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Using the data a decision tree regression model was
trained to predict the transcoding time of a video based on the video's characteristics. The model information is accessed
from a flask server that provides this information.

## Deployment

This project is live at <https://capstoneproject.snorton.dev/>.
This project can also be ran locally as a server using the following steps:

* Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
* Install the requirments using `pip3 install -r requirments.txt`
* Run the flask server from the route directory using `python3 app.py`
* In your browser nagigate to localhost:8080

## Requirements

* Python 3.10.2
* Modules found in `requirements.txt`
